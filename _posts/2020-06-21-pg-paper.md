Our policy gradient paper was rejected from the IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering. 

I was of course dissapointed by the decision, but to my surprise, the reviews were extremely on point and thorough. Furthermore, it turns out that the journal only has a 20 % acceptance rate which is on par with the top conferences in the field. 

I will now discuss each major comment and add my own opionions on the matter:

1. Does the world really need another paper that show incremental performance gain on the Hovorka simulator? Especially given the sample complexity of an online policy gradient approach this seems highly unlikely. 

I am sorry to say that I agree 100% with this comment. What then begs the question is what should we do next? We spent quite a lot of time getting the RL algorithms to converge on the Hovorka model. If that is not suitable for publication, that means that we have in essence wasted a lot of time and that we will be stuck without getting credit for our work.
